## Part 1: Q-Learning and Policy Iteration on the Frozen Lake Environment

Implementing a basic version of Q-Learning on the Frozen Lake environment using OpenAI Gym. Tasks included:
1. Understanding the Frozen Lake environment and its dynamics.
2. Implementing the Q-Learning algorithm with guidance from the tutorial.
3. Training the Q-Learning agent on the Frozen Lake environment.
4. Evaluating agent performance and analyzing the impact of hyperparameters on the learning process, specifically `alpha`, `gamma`, and `epsilon`.
5. Implementing the policy iteration algorithm and comparing its performance to Q-Learning.

## Part 2: Proximal Policy Optimization on an Atari Game Environment

Adapting the Q-Learning code from Part 1 to an Atari game environment chosen from the OpenAI Gym library and implementing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for comparison. Tasks included:
1. Choosing an Atari game environment from the OpenAI Gym library.
2. Adapting the Q-Learning code to work with the chosen Atari game environment.
3. Training the Q-Learning agent on the Atari game environment.
4. Implementing the PPO algorithm following provided guidelines and references.
5. Training the PPO agent on the same Atari game environment.
6. Comparing the performance of Q-Learning and PPO agents by examining mean reward over time.
